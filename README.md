# Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gesture
It's an AI-based virtual mouse project that uses Python and OpenCV for real-time hand gesture tracking. It detects and tracks hand landmarks using Mediapipe and maps gestures to mouse actions. Pyautogui is utilized to control mouse movement and clicks. This project offers an alternative way of controlling the mouse without a physical device, enhancing user interaction with computers. It showcases the power of computer vision and AI in creating intuitive and hands-free interfaces.


**To run the project, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:**
1. OpenCV: Used for image processing and drawing.
2. Mediapipe: Enables hand tracking for gesture recognition.
3. Pyautogui: Allows for controlling mouse movement and clicks.
4. NumPy: Fundamental library for scientific computing in Python.

To use the virtual mouse, first install the MediaPipe library and the pyautogui library. Then, run the `Virtual_Mouse.py` script. The script will open a window that shows the camera feed from your computer's webcam. You can then use your hands to control the mouse cursor.

Here are some of the things you can do with the virtual mouse:

* Click the left mouse button by raising your index finger.
* Move the mouse cursor by raising your middle finger.
* Scroll up and down by raising your ring finger.
* Zoom in and out by raising your pinky finger and thumb together.
* Take a screenshot by raising your index finger and ring finger together.
